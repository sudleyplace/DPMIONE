TEST23	 -- Version 2.00 -- A DPMI Ctrl-Break Test Program
   (C) Copyright 1992 Qualitas, Inc.  All rights reserved.

This program tests Ctrl-Break under a DPMI host.  The program syntax
is as follows:

Syntax:  TEST23 [options]

where options consists one or more of

/P=n where n=0 (IRET/D), 1 (RETF CF=0), 2 (RETF CF=1), 3 (JMPF), 4 (CALLF)
     for PM INT 23h setting
/V=n where n=0 (IRET/D), 1 (RETF CF=0), 2 (RETF CF=1), 3 (JMPF), 4 (CALLF)
     for VM INT 23h setting
/S   Enter PM as small (16-bit) DPMI client

To install a PM handler only, use /P=n without /V=n, and vice versa.
To install both handlers with the PM handler first, use /P=n /V=n.  To
install the VM handler first, use /V=n /P=n.

The /P= and /V= options are order-dependent:  in case it makes a
difference in your host implementation, the interrupt handlers are
installed in the same order as the /P= or /V= keywords are specified
on the command line.  If your implementation is not order-dependent,
and you are testing with both handlers installed, place the handler
which is called first on the right.  For example, with 386MAX as the
host, the PM handler is always called first even if there is a VM
handler installed.  In this case, always use the form /V=n /P=n.

All handlers are installed after the switch from VM to PM is made (and
are done through DPMI calls).

The different values for /P= and /V= are described as follows:

0	 The handler IRETs which should cause the host to ignore the
	   event.

1	 The handler RETFs with CF=0 which should cause the host to
	   ignore the event.

2	 The handler RETFs with CF=1 which should cause the host to
	   terminate the program.

3	 The handler CHAINs to the next handler in sequence via JMPF
	   which should cause the host to ignore this handler.

4	 The handler CHAINs to the next handler in sequence via CALLF
	   which should cause the host to ignore this handler.	Note
	   that if the CALLF handler is called first, it should
	   continue execution following the CALLF; TEST23 tests to
	   see that that happens.

The first three values (0-2) cause the handler to make a decision.
The last two values (3-4) do not.

The resulting expected actions are to terminate the program or ignore
the Ctrl-Break.

The program tests that the following rules are followed:

R1.  If the PM handler only is installed, then the resulting actions
for values /P=0 to 4 should be identical to the resulting actions were
the VM handler only installed, and vice versa.	That is, it shouldn't
matter whether the decision is made in PM or VM if it's the same
decision.

R2.  If both handlers are installed and the first handler called makes
a decision (values 0-2), then the other handler is not called.

R3.  If both handlers are installed and the first handler called does
not make a decision (values 3-4), then the resulting actions are the
same as if the second handler only were installed.  That is, chaining
is equivalent to not being installed.


Some questions occur for which the TEST23 program assumes specific
answers but which may be different in your implementation:

Q1.  If both handlers are installed, which one is called first?

A1a.  The PM handler;
A1b.  The VM handler (???);
A1c.  The last one which was hooked (that is, the order in which INT
	23h is hooked by PM and VM is significant);
A1d.  The first one which was hooked (???).

My reading of the DPMI spec says that such interrupts should be
reflected to PM first, then VM.  Thus, 386MAX calls the PM handler
first.	Your mileage may differ.


Q2.  If no handlers are installed, what is the default action?

A2a.  Terminate the program immediately;
A2b.  Set a flag and terminate the program at a later (and presumably
	safer) time;
A2c.  Ignore the event.

The answer for 386MAX is to take the same action as DOS does for a VM
program without DPMI, which is to terminate the program.  Moreover, we
take that action immediately, after cleaning up the DPMI client in PM.

For reference, the settings and actions taken by 386MAX are as
follows:

Setting 	 Action

/V=0		 Ignore     (same as /P=0 alone)
   1		 Ignore     (same as /P=1 alone)

   3		 Terminate  (same as if no handlers)
   4		 Terminate  (same as if no handlers)

Please get back to me with your comments on these rules, how your DPMI
host interprets Ctrl-Break, what your DPMI client expects, how we can
ever get consistent behavior amongst the various hosts/clients, etc.
